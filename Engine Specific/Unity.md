This document is an overview on how to get started developing accessibility features in Unity

Unity has a practical game accessibility course that you can follow [here](https://learn.unity.com/course/practical-game-accessibility).

You will need the [UI Accessibility Plugin (UAP)](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/ui-accessibility-plugin-uap-87935).

We will continue documenting these further :)
